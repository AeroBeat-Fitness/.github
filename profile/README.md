# Welcome to AeroBeat Workouts

**AeroBeat** is an open-source, modular rhythm game platform designed to democratize fitness gaming. Think of it as the "YouTube of Workout Games"—a place where hardware inputs, gameplay mechanics, and community content can be mixed and matched freely.

## 🚀 The Vision

We are building a platform, not just a game. Our architecture separates **Input** (How you move), **Logic** (The rules of the game), and **Content** (The music and visuals).

*   **Hardware Agnostic:** Play using a Webcam (MediaPipe), VR Controllers, JoyCons, or even a Keyboard.
*   **Modular Gameplay:** Swap the "Core Mechanic" instantly. Go from **Boxing**, **Flow**, **Dance** and **Step** rhythm gameplay styles without changing the engine.
*   **Community First:** Built for modding. Artists can skin targets, Musicians can map songs, and Coders can write new input drivers.
*   **Agent Ready:** Engineered to be ready for Orchestrated Agents workflows.
